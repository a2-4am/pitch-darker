[description]
 
 "Move!" you shout over the storm, shoving the Ambassador into the shuttle
 then slamming the outer door closed, giving the vessel a solid rap when all
 is secure. Backing up a few steps, you immediately lose the craft in the
 driving rain, with only the whine of the engines indicating which way not to
 go.
 
 You turn away, struggling against rising winds as you retrace your steps to
 your fighter and crawl inside, cringing when the shuttle's premature
 lift-off sends a barrage of stones against your hull. Great, just what you
 needed -- more dents.
 
 Skipping preflight, you quickly check your straps, grab the stick and flip
 the switch to fire the engines.
 
 Nothing happens.
