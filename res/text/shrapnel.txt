[description]
 
 You are standing west of a white house with a boarded front door.
 
 You blink. Boarded? You came all this way and the door is boarded?
 
 Is this supposed to be some sort of game?
 
 Towering Carolina pines loom all around this clearing, silhouetted in the
 dusk; soon it will be night.
 
 It occurs to you that you have no memory at all of how you got here.
