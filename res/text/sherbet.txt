[description]
 
 Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of the
 breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia. As if she
 weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in
 the setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing
 anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador.
 
 The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very slowly
 to the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your elephant's
 wickerwork basket, you're just level with the branches of the old Imperial
 hunting woods inside the wall.
 
 Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every day
 for a fortnight, you're just desperate to get away.
 
 The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping onto
 the flagstones with a dull, regular boom.
