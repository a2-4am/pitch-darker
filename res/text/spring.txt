[description]
 
 It's been a hectic year, and it's time to get away. He told you that, and
 you agreed. Now, after weeks of travel and thousands of miles, you start to
 wish for some of the comforts of home. As good as it's been, there's just
 one important thing missing: when was the last time you had a real bath?
 
 You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all
 directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin fingers,
 stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of gold rattle as
 the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others
 that crackle underfoot when you move.
