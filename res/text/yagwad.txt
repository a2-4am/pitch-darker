[description]
 
 The ledge narrows dangerously. You press your taut bronzed body against the
 cliff face as a dislodged rock soars into the emptiness below. The night sky
 yawns black and starless, waiting to swallow you whole. Sliding around the
 point of a spur you find yourself at the mouth of a glittering cave.
 
 You have found her! She looks up at you, wild eyes glinting through a
 dishevelled veil of hair.
 
 The ledge widens here at the mouth of a deep cave. The light from several
 flickering torches sparkles and dances as it reflects back from the tonnes
 of gold coins and precious stones piled carelessly about.
 
 Amidst the loot stands a stalagmite encrusted with saltpetre.
 
 The woman is chained near the cliff edge, her hair tangled and clothes
 ripped to the merest rags. She looks up as you approach. Her chest heaves -
 "You've come!" she breathes.
