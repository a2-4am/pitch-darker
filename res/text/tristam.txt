[description]
 
 After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island,
 with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was
 inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a
 fence around the white house at the top of the hill?
 
 TRISTAM ISLAND is a text adventure made from the mold of Infocom; expect a
 large geography to explore, lots of prose, a rich parser, diverse puzzles,
 some humor and some darkness. To use Infocom's classification, I'd rate the
 game's difficulty as "Standard"; however, the game's design is modern and
 eschews all the frustrations commonly associated with 1980s text
 adventures. No hunger timers, no frustrating mazes, no blocking situations
 that force you to restart!
