[description]
 
 Ever since the Provider's sickness began, he's been all hisses and growls.
 Even the slightest misstep annoys him. Maybe that's why your bowl has held
 nothing but hard food lately. And not much of that.
 
 You awaken to a faint twitter. Perhaps a trick of the rising light, you
 pinpoint a fluttering shape. Your quickened breath frosts the window pane,
 the dawn promising no ordinary day.
