[description]
 
 Something inside is telling you to wake up. Part of your mind says "Sunrise
 approaches."
 
 Underneath your dream you feel a deep shiver... It is a chime, the bell of a
 clock-tower. Another follows, and another. You count them, fully awake
 suddenly, counting them down. Six. Five. Four. Three.
 
 Your eyes close, and your stomach tightens in anticipation. The sheets
 around you feel very safe.
 
 Two. One.
 
 The first ray of sunlight lances through the slats in the window-blind. It
 strikes your eyes, and you feel yourself go.
