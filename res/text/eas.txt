[description]
 
 It's been almost a month since your parents disappeared.
 
 One Tuesday, they just didn't come home, and there's been no sign of them
 since. For the University and the rest of the town, the mystery is beginning
 to pall. To those people, it's as if Claire and Scott Colborn suddenly
 stopped existing -- strange and inexplicable, to be sure, but forgettable in
 the long run.
 
 But for you it's as if the ground beneath your feet stopped existing, and
 you've been plummeting in freefall ever since. Your brother Austin, though,
 has been a rock through the whole experience, handling the numbing details,
 the endless meetings with useless detectives, even sorting through Mom and
 Dad's lab in hopes of finding an answer. Now you stand outside the lab door,
 clutching his note, hardly daring to hope that such an answer may have
 arrived at long last.
