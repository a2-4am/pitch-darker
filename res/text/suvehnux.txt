[description]
 
 "Yes, master?"
 
 You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a
 fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.
 
 He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the
 scroll -- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this
 little beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes
 back to my private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."
 
 You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide
 open, and a golden key juts out of the lock.
 
 Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the
 brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud
 "click", and everything turns black.
