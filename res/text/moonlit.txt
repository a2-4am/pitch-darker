 Genre: fantasy
 Difficulty: ^^^&&

[description]
 
 No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a
 mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of
 flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.
 
 Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in
 calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs
 spiral downward.
