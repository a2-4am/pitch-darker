[description]
 
 I wake up.
 
 With horror I realise that I'll have to spend another day in St. Enda's
 college. A familiar fact I have to face each morning - but four years here
 have not made it any easier to face. St. Enda's - how I have come to despise
 this place. A decrepit old red-brick shagpile which has become the focal
 point of this filthy little town in the arse-end of nowhere. The cheapest
 boarding school in the country, probably, but also surely the most pompous
 and inflated. A haven for the worst kind of social climbers, parvenus,
 thick, ignorant farmers' sons...
 
 With horror I also realise that I am an asshole. Another familiar fact, and
 the last seventeen years have given me little reason to doubt it. I could
 happily pick apart my faults all day - I'm too short, too shy, indecisive,
 and uncharismatic. And I've got terrible posture.
