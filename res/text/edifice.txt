[description]
 
 Life is pretty routine. Search for Food. Eat it. Hide from Enemies. Ignore
 the Others. Then one day, you notice a staggeringly tall Edifice, right here
 in the middle of the forest. Has it been here before?
 
 Here, in the forest where you have spent your entire life, stands a huge
 Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.
 
 The Others are here, doing typically boring things.
 
 Though you can't see them, you sense your Enemies lurk nearby.
