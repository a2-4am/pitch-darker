[description]
 
 Darkness. Quickly, this is followed by a burning white light accompanied by
 intense pain rocketing up and down your body. Your efforts to scream are
 initially silent, giving way after a few seconds to a piercing scream as the
 bright light fades...
 
 Coming around in a lighthouse with no memory of who you are or how you got
 there, can you solve the mystery and win the game?
