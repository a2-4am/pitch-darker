[description]
 
 Another day, another dollar! Life is good at the moment, the property market
 is booming. Still, it does have its down side; when showing those Mulluer
 Corporation executives around that old theatre dump, err, opportunity you
 must have left your pager down in the basement. Better hurry, you have to
 meet the others at the opera in an hour, and be careful. It wouldn't do to
 show up with your clothes all dirty.
 
 This room is a tribute to the now-faded glory of the theatre. The still-
 smiling faces of forgotten productions stare out from faded posters at you.
