[description]
 
 Shuffling down the garden path, Balrog pushes open the door to the smallest-
 room and enters, before removing his bathrobe and dropping it on to the cold
 stone slabs that formed the base of the hut. Amidst great clouds of green
 gas and accompanied by a multitude of thunderous noises, Balrog spent the
 next twenty minutes performing his morning business .....
 
 As the last tendrils of green-gas drifted skywards, Balrog rises to his
 feet, puts on his bathrobe and tightens the drawstring. "Time for breakfast"
 he thinks, as a great smile crosses his face.
