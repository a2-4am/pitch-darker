[description]
 
 Craverly Heights is a short game with a lot of creativity. You play
 Dr. Langridge, a brilliant physician at Roland Memorial Hospital. Pauline,
 your patient, is in desperate need of an operation. Sadly, her insurance is
 refusing to pay for it, which saddles you with the laborious task of trying
 to raise the money yourself.
 
 A dramatic setup quickly mutates into a comedy of bad acting and
 ad-libbing. The map is small, but the rooms have a lot of personality. The
 characters are mostly static, but their dialogue does change depending on
 what you are wearing. There are multiple endings.
