[description]
 
 What was that?
 
 You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either.
 That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like
 searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.
 
 "No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl
 around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare.
 Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg,
 who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."
 
 After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to
 stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their
 elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses
 his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.
