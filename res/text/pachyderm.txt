[description]
 
 Now you are gonna be in trouble. You are well aware of the fact that you are
 not allowed to keep pets in your apartment, but you could not leave your
 dear pet elephant behind when you moved in. He is your friend. You did your
 best to keep him hidden from the neighbors and your landlord Julius
 Vanderbuilt, an aged man with a stern look.
 
 But someone must have noticed the trumpeting earlier today, and now some
 person is knocking at your door, so you need to react.
