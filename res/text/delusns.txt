[description]
 
 Reality is so... unreal.
 
 The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of
 consensus, phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and unbecoming,
 back and forth eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with and within
 infinite variations of itself...
 
 At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own
 perception of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times a
 day. But it's your job, working to someday entertain others with new
 observations, new experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed up
 for the Project (as you well remember, even though it was close to five
 years ago), so you suppose it's entirely your fault if you don't like
 it. Which, when you think about it, you realise you do.
 
 Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay, this
 should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential, and this
 world is done! I'm starting her up."
 
 A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

 "Brace yourself!"
 
 Bright lights.
 
 Pain.
 
 From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.
 
 Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your vision
 clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.
 
 All five of them.
 
 Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.
 
 Virtual reality has become reality.
