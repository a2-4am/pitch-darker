[description]
 
 You've heard about the 8-Bit Assembly for ages, and this year you finally
 get to attend for yourself! You've been looking forward to it all year, and
 you plan to participate in everything the event has to offer.
 
 Sure, you've heard the rumours of black magic and bizarre occurrences at
 Rockwurst College. But those can't be true, can they? The guys on the Eaten
 By A Grue podcast must've been joking. Funny that they never put out another
 episode after they attended the event. That's probably a coincidence.
 
 I mean, it's an Apple II convention. What's the worst that could happen?
