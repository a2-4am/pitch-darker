[description]
 
 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the sound
 of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a violent jolt
 followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation. The last thing you
 remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and regret, forcing its way
 through the chaos that surrounds you and then there is...
 
 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are
 opened or closed. Concepts like time and place have no meaning here. Your
 mind attempts to impose something, some order, some structure, upon the
 space in which you exist, and fails. There is only the void. For all you
 know, that is all there ever was.
