[description]
 
 It is pitch black. You are a grue.
 
 You are wedged comfortably into your lair, relaxing in the cold comfort of a
 stone crevice, the walls worn smooth by years of occupation. Here, the
 darkness is complete, like Mother's comforting, opaque fur. No luminous
 fungi or glowing worms venture here with their harsh, painful light.
 
 And your eyes are closed.
