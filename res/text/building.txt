[description]
 
 You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with
 strobe lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you
 can feel the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through
 your back; eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the
 hall. You hold your breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts
 and the scene shifts.
 
 You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the stars
 sit in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks and
 they pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm
 clocks. The scene shifts again.
 
 Every action seems in slow-motion as though you were moving through time.
 You raise your head to look in the mirror and see yourself growing older, a
 year for every moment. You turn away and look back to see a skeleton staring
 back at you, its jaws gibbering madly.
 
 Then you are sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake,
 blinking into focus a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The
 abandoned parking lot and the broken streets keen with secrets just out of
 reach. Before you is the building. It lurks like a coiled dragon, a
 summation of fear and deadly challenge, of past and of present. You hear a
 final distant voice that seems a greeting as well as benediction, "This is
 the dark night of the soul."
