 by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)

[description]
 
 Nearly. Nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow,
 try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.
 
 A faint rustling echoes deep in the side chamber, and the laughing chitter
 of bats.
 
 Something shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk.
 
 Your prey.
