 Late Thursday night. You've had a hard day and the last thing you need is
 this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and you're progressing
 rapidly.
 
 On to the next aisle.
 
 Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since... Rome.
 
 The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves on
 either side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket, with only
 the brightly coloured aisle markers visible.
 
 You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright plastic bags
 full of pale skin-tone shapes.
 
 There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with
 sauces.
