[description]
 
 "Oh, Julia! Where did you learn that?" Keith whispers breathlessly.
 
 All tongue and fingers, he kisses the milky skin above your breasts, while
 your hands slide their way up and down his sculpted chest, so eager with
 lust that your watch occasionally snags on a stray chest hair. Your lips,
 glistening like two fresh strawberries laced with dew, hungrily roam across
 his neck. And your hips! Well, that's better left to the imagination.
 
 Normally, you wouldn't even consider seeing Keith at Pine Meadows, but
 Frank's in Boston and won't be back until tonight's banquet.  And when the
 cat's away...
 
 Just then, a low shelf wedges itself in to your back, jarring you from your
 reverie. That's when you hear it.
 
 A click. A flash. The tell-tale tapping of heels on concrete.
