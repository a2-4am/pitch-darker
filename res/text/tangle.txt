[description]
 
 On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
 grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains
 were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with
 squat brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its
 historic charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks
 below tenements -- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley
 can conceal balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or
 bed of flowers nurtured by who knows who.
 
 This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick,
 and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a
 handle. Maybe you should call it a day.
