 Genre: science fiction

[description]
 
 Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold,
 tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you
 lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept
 the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect.
 Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for
 a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the
 fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous
 pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting
 place of the fabled Jewel.
