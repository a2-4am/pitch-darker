[description]
 
 You're Tracy Valencia, first-year student at the reasonably prestigious
 University of Dorado. Sure, it's not Berkeley (hell, it isn't even
 Stanford), but it's light-years better than Dorado State, where your older
 brother Trevor goes. Dorado State's just a party school. Trevor makes a
 point of rubbing this in every time he calls.
 
 He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and
 you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket,
 but like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend
 the money on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow.
 Besides, it's only a four-hour drive.
