 ADVENTURE: the interactive original

 Donald Ekman, David M. Baggett (1993) and Graham Nelson (1994)
 Genre: fantasy
 Difficulty: ^^^&&

[description]
 
 This port is fairly close to the original. The puzzles, items and places of
 Woods's original 350-point version are exactly those here.
 
 The scoring system is the original, except that you no longer lose 4 points
 for quitting, and it awards 5 points for currently carrying a treasure (as
 some early 1980s ports did). The rank names are tidied up a little. The only
 significant rule change is that you cannot use magic words until their
 destinations have been visited.
 
 The dwarves are simpler in their movements, but on the other hand it adds a
 few messages to make them interact better with the rest of the game. The
 probabilities are the same as the original game.
 
 The text itself is almost everywhere preserved intact, with some corrected
 spelling and grammatical mistakes (and a couple of utterly misleading and
 gnomic remarks).
