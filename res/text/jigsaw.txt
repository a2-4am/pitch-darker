[description]
 
 New Year's Eve, 1999, a quarter to midnight and where else to be but Century
 Park! Fireworks cascade across the sky, your stomach rumbles uneasily, music
 and lasers howl across the parkland...
 
 Not exactly your ideal party (especially as that rather attractive stranger
 in black has slipped back into the crowds) - but cheer up, you won't live to
 see the next.
