 You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st
 century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived:
 Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into
 gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world
 went to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always
 claiming that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a
 huge mansion and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of
 yore, when websites were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown
 willy-nilly onto a computer screen.
 
 Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide
 your smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a
 surprise to learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a
 surprise to discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his
 massive fortune in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short
 note explaining that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the
 second half of Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor.
 The very name brings chills to your spine: that place is haunted!
 
 But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:
 
 Leave your Smartphone at home!
