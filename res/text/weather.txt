[description]
 
 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered away
 from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's just that
 after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend cook-out isn't
 the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing
 thought.
 
 None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.
 
 The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
 afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden
 bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby
 hillside stretches upward.
