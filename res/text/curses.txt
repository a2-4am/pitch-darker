[description]
 
 It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris
 must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five
 years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your
 great- grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...
 
 The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
 tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
 fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are.
 But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.
 
 A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.
