[description]
 
 The sun has gone. It must be brought. You have a rock.
 
 Sweetness fills the shade of the High Wall to your east. Under this
 sweetness lies a small expanse of fod. A mobile releases mildly to the west;
 far in that direction a tower proudly plants itself, while the ground rises
 more slowly to the south and relaxes to the north.
 
 Spread on the resting is a guidebook.
 
 Sleep gradually departs from your eyes. A small stone has been insinuated
 into your hand.
