[description]
 
 In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy
 mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter
 solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the
 outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest
 companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill with a
 fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he lies. Young
 Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such circumstances would cause the
 fanciful events that were to occur upon this solstice eve.
