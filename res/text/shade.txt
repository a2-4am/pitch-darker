[description]
 
 Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness
 pools in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares
 yellow, but the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.
 
 Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer
 shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on a cardboard
 crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet
 to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it
 halfway works. One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly
 shut.
