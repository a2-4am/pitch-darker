[description]
 
 Dozing lazily in the morning sun in your little hut, something suddenly

 Vigorously shaking the dust off of your fur, you have a sudden insight: the
 perfect shape of a bone forms in your mind. Yeah, that's it! Somewhere,
 somehow, there must still be a bone left from last fall. If only you could
 remember where it was...
